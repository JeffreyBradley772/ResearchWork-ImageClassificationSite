# ResearchWork-ImageClassificationSite
Developing website to culminate research work in applying machine learning methods for image classification of ovarian structures in rats. Using Flask and AWS Beanstalk.

##### Saved classifier model too large for github. Run application.py for most up to date version. Will be uploaded to Washington and Lee University's AWS Server once final permissions are given.
